# Ant_Parade-Public
This repository is responsible for *deployment* of **Kubernetes** Environments and Workloads that are actively managed by SoFMeRight.

This repository is public space, however it is not a product. As such you can depend on its availability on some level as this code is slotted to become essential to SoFMeRight's homelab. However the code contained within this repository is without warranty, you are welcome to raise issues if you wish; no guarantee of any outcome as result however. Having a lab without issues is ideal so it is likely for issues to be addressed. But the scope of this repo is from business to personal and as such it is very paricular the way in which an outside entity might influence the development of this repo. At the very least/especially in these early stages! That being said, if you the person reading this so happen not to be SoFMeRight or internal to PrPlanIT, we don't mean to scare you away! WELCOME to SoFMeRight's K8s lab ~ WIP! Hope you enjoy your stay! 👋🏽

# Bootstrapping a cephadm cluster.
You will need a number of Linux based machines I used 5 with 2 VMs per each with a master and worker each.
It is advised to transfer ssh keys for password-less authentication and to configure sudo without a prompt.
First we run the script that installs dependencies on each node.
```
bash onboarding/bootstrap-k8s-install-dependencies.sh
```
This next script we run on the first node we intend to assign as a master ~ a control plane node.
```
bash onboarding/bootstrap-k8s-initialize-control-plane.sh
```
If all goes well we should see a message something like:
```
Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

Alternatively, if you are the root user, you can run:

  export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of control-plane nodes by copying certificate authorities
and service account keys on each node and then running the following as root:

  kubeadm join dungeon-map-001:6443 --token kxgj2w.ucvyopdyulxzdnw4 \
        --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:6a85476457676767657676677676767677466776547567447d \
        --control-plane 

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join dungeon-map-001:6443 --token kxgj2w.ucvyopdyulxzdnw4 \
        --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha25567474567567567567567767676767676767676776764576457fb47d
```
From here you simply use the commands supplied on the corresponding master and worker nodes, but  do prepend with a sudo!
When attempting to add additional control plane nodes I had an issue with needing a single service address so I configured HAProxy within pfSense for this need and set the Virtual IP in the /home/<user>/.kuber/config i.e. "server: https://172.22.22.105:6443".
I also used the following command to label each of my workers accordingly:
```
kubectl label node dungeon-worker-001 node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=worker
```
I had issues with kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server, they were resolved via a variation of these instructions: https://serverfault.com/questions/1153770/installed-metrics-server-in-kubernetes-cluster-but-getting-serviceunavailable
```
wget https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml
kubectl apply -f components.yaml
kubectl patch deployment metrics-server -n kube-system --type='json' -p='[ \

# Configuring the Ansible control node for K8s ~ Kustomize testing
First we ssh to a k8s master node and check the running kustomize version.
```
kai@ant-parade:~$ ssh dungeon-map-001
Welcome to Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 6.8.0-51-generic x86_64)
... ... ...
Last login: Sat Jan 18 10:10:14 2025 from 172.22.22.110
kai@dungeon-map-001:~$ kubectl version
Client Version: v1.31.4
Kustomize Version: v5.4.2
Server Version: v1.31.0
```
After pulling the git we ran the installer.sh we repackaged for convenience.
```
bash Ant_Parade/onboarding/install-kustomize.sh 5.4.2
```
# Bootstrapping fluxcd:
```
flux bootstrap git   --url=ssh://git@<localgitip>:1234/precisionplanit/ant_parade-public   --branch=main   --private-key-file=/root/.ssh/id_rsa   --password=   --path=clusters/overlays/production
```
# Pulling the repo to your local directory:
```
git clone ssh://git@172.22.22.123:2222/PrecisionPlanIT/Ant_Parade.git
```
# Updating the repo after making edits on a local clone:
Check the source repo to compare against our changes.
```
git fetch --all
```
Either merge,
```
git merge origin/main
```
OR rebase (I hear rebase can help to preserve the history a little better perhaps?)
```
git rebase origin/main
```
Now add a commit:
```
git add .
git commit -m "<An optimistic note about something that we promise to be better about.>"
```
On the first run it may ask you to provide info regarding your identity (then retry the previous command):
```
git config --global user.email "kai.hamil@gmail.com"
git config --global user.name "kai"
```
# Push to the source repo
```
git push origin main
```
# Pulling any additional changes occurred after the initial pull.
```
git pull origin main
```
# Sudo does not run without password on target host
Use the ``sudo visudo`` command to edit the permissions for usage of sudo command.
Look for a line that looks like this in the config:
```
# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command
%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```
Update the line to look like such:
```
# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command
%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```
# Resolving Ansible "REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED" issue (Ansible Semaphore)
Use the ``docker exec -it semaphore-semaphore-1 sh`` command to open a shell into the Semaphore docker container.

Edit the ansible configuration file using ``nano /home/semaphore/ansible.cfg``, adapt your current config to contain the following:

```
[defaults]
host_key_checking = False
```
At this point playbooks that fail due to this issue should succeed and we can use an ansible playbook to add this host properly to the known host list.
